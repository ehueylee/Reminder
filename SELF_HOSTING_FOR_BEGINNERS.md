# üè† Self-Hosting Guide for Non-Technical Users

**Own your data. No coding required.**

This guide helps you run the Smart Reminder App on your own computer, so your reminders stay private and under your control.

## üéØ What is Self-Hosting?

**Instead of using a website someone else controls:**
- ‚úÖ You run the app on YOUR computer
- ‚úÖ Your reminders are stored on YOUR hard drive
- ‚úÖ Nobody else can see your data
- ‚úÖ No monthly fees
- ‚úÖ Works even without internet (after setup)

**Think of it like:** Using Microsoft Word on your computer instead of Google Docs online.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

You need:
- ‚úÖ Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
- ‚úÖ 30 minutes of time
- ‚úÖ Administrator access to your computer
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key (costs ~$0.15/month for typical use)

**No coding experience required!** Just copy-paste the commands.

## üéâ Using Your Self-Hosted App

### Access on Your Computer

1. Open any web browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:8001**
3. Create reminders using natural language!

### Access on Your Phone (Same WiFi)

1. Find your computer's IP address:

   ```
   Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   
   **Mac:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep inet
   ```
   Look for number like 192.168.1.100

2. On your phone's browser, go to:
   ```
   http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:8001
   ```
   Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8001`

3. **Install as PWA on iPhone:**
   - Open in Safari
   - Tap Share button
   - "Add to Home Screen"
   - Now it's a native-like app!

## üîÑ Daily Use

### Starting the App Each Day

**Create a Desktop Shortcut (Windows):**

1. Create a new text file called `start-reminder.bat`
2. Add this content:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Reminder
   call venv\Scripts\activate
   python main.py
   pause
   ```
3. Save and double-click to start!

**Create a Shortcut (Mac):**

1. Create a file called `start-reminder.command`
2. Add this content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd ~/Documents/Reminder
   source venv/bin/activate
   python main.py
   ```
3. Make executable: `chmod +x start-reminder.command`
4. Double-click to start!

### Stopping the App

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window
- Or just close the terminal

### Auto-Start on Boot (Optional)

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**
1. Search "Task Scheduler" in Start menu
2. Click "Create Basic Task"
3. Name: "Start Reminder App"
4. Trigger: "When I log on"
5. Action: "Start a program"
6. Program: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Reminder\venv\Scripts\python.exe`
7. Arguments: `main.py`
8. Start in: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Reminder`

**Mac (Login Items):**
1. Open System Preferences ‚Üí Users & Groups
2. Click "Login Items"
3. Click "+" and select `start-reminder.command`

---

## üíæ Your Data Location

All your reminders are stored in:
```
Documents/Reminder/reminders.db
```

**This is YOUR file. Nobody else has access.**

**To backup:**
1. Copy `reminders.db` to USB drive or cloud storage
2. That's it! Your entire reminder history is in that one file

**To restore:**
1. Copy `reminders.db` back to the Reminder folder
2. Restart the app
3. All reminders appear!

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

### What Leaves Your Computer?

**Only this goes to external servers:**
- ‚úÖ Natural language text ‚Üí OpenAI (for parsing)
  - Example: "Call dentist tomorrow at 2pm"
  - OpenAI parses it, sends back structured data
  - OpenAI does NOT store your reminders
  
- ‚úÖ Email notifications ‚Üí Gmail SMTP (if configured)
  - Only when reminder is due
  - Optional - can disable

**What stays on your computer:**
- ‚úÖ All reminder data (reminders.db)
- ‚úÖ Scheduler state
- ‚úÖ Application code

**Nobody can access:**
- ‚ùå Your reminder database
- ‚ùå Your .env configuration
- ‚ùå Your API keys (unless you share them)

### Maximum Privacy Mode

Want even more privacy? Skip email notifications:

1. In `.env`, remove or comment out SMTP settings:
   ```env
   # SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com  # Disabled
   # SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password     # Disabled
   ```
2. Restart app
3. No emails sent - reminders only visible in web UI

**Trade-off:** You must check the app yourself for reminders.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Python is not recognized"

**Fix:**
1. Reinstall Python
2. Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Restart computer

### "pip is not recognized"

**Fix:**
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### "OpenAI API error"

**Fix:**
1. Check API key in `.env` is correct
2. Verify you have credits: https://platform.openai.com/usage
3. Make sure key starts with `sk-`

### "Cannot connect to API"

**Fix:**
1. Make sure app is running (check terminal)
2. Use `http://localhost:8001` not `https://`
3. Try `http://127.0.0.1:8001` instead

### "Email notifications not working"

**Fix:**
1. Verify Gmail App Password (16 characters, no spaces)
2. Check 2-Step Verification is enabled on Google account
3. Look in spam folder
4. Check terminal for error messages

### Port 8001 already in use

**Fix - Use different port:**
Edit `main.py`, change last line:
```python
uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8002, reload=True)
```
Then access: `http://localhost:8002`

## üì± Access from Anywhere (Advanced)

Want to access from outside your home network?

### Option 1: Use Tailscale (Easiest)

Tailscale creates a private network between your devices.

- ‚úÖ Quick setup
- ‚úÖ HTTPS included
- ‚úÖ Shareable URL

**Cons:**

3. Add YOUR_OPENAI_KEY as environment variable
4. Access from anywhere via Railway URL

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Professional hosting
- ‚úÖ Always accessible
- ‚úÖ HTTPS automatic
