## Questions?

Common questions answered:

**Q: Do I need to create all 9 icon sizes?**
A: Yes, but PWA Builder auto-generates them all from one 512x512 image.

**Q: Can I test without deploying?**
A: Yes! Run `python main.py` and access from iPhone on same WiFi using your computer's IP address.

**Q: Will this work on Android too?**
A: Yes! PWAs work even better on Android (full push notification support).

**Q: How do I update the app after installation?**
A: Just update your code and redeploy. Service worker will auto-update next time user opens app.

**Q: Can users find this in the App Store?**
A: No, PWAs can't be listed in Apple App Store. Share via URL and users install via Safari.

**Q: Should I still build a React Native app?**
A: Not necessarily! Try the PWA first. If you need push notifications or App Store presence later, you can always build React Native version using the code in `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_IPHONE.md`.
