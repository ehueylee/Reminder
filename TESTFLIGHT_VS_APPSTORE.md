## üîÑ **Using Both Together** (Recommended)

Most successful developers use **both simultaneously**:

### **The Smart Strategy**

```
TestFlight = Beta/Experimental
App Store = Stable/Production

Example Timeline:

Week 1-2: TestFlight Internal (v1.1-beta)
‚îú‚îÄ Test new calendar integration
‚îú‚îÄ Fix bugs with 10 team members
‚îî‚îÄ Iterate daily

Week 3-4: TestFlight External (v1.1-beta)
‚îú‚îÄ Share public link
‚îú‚îÄ Get 200 beta testers
‚îú‚îÄ Collect feedback
‚îî‚îÄ Upload fixes weekly

Week 5: App Store (v1.0-stable)
‚îú‚îÄ Current stable version
‚îú‚îÄ Public using reliable version
‚îî‚îÄ Good reviews maintained

Week 6: When v1.1 is solid
‚îú‚îÄ Submit v1.1 to App Store
‚îú‚îÄ Start testing v1.2 on TestFlight
‚îî‚îÄ Cycle continues
```

---

### **Parallel Development Example**

**What Users See**:

```
App Store:
"Reminder App v1.0"
- Core reminder features
- Email notifications
- Stable, polished
- 4.5 star rating

TestFlight:
"Reminder App v1.2 Beta"
- Testing calendar sync (new!)
- Testing Siri shortcuts (new!)
- May have bugs
- Testers give feedback
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Public users always have stable version
- ‚úÖ Beta testers get cutting-edge features
- ‚úÖ You can test boldly without affecting ratings
- ‚úÖ Build hype for upcoming features
- ‚úÖ Early feedback prevents bad App Store releases

## ‚ùì **Common Questions**

### **Q: Can I submit to App Store without TestFlight?**
**A**: Yes! TestFlight is optional. You can submit directly to App Store. However, TestFlight testing is highly recommended to catch bugs.

---

### **Q: Do TestFlight testers become App Store users automatically?**
**A**: No. They must download your app from the App Store separately when it launches. Many will!

---

### **Q: Can I charge for TestFlight?**
**A**: No. TestFlight is free testing only. You can't charge testers or test in-app purchases (well, you can test IAP flow, but no real money).

---

### **Q: Will TestFlight feedback become App Store reviews?**
**A**: No. TestFlight feedback is private (only you see it). App Store reviews are public.

---

### **Q: Can I remove my app from App Store later?**
**A**: Yes. You can remove it anytime. Users who already downloaded it can keep using it, but new users can't download.

---

### **Q: What happens to testers when I go to App Store?**
**A**: Nothing changes automatically. They can continue testing beta builds. Encourage them to download the App Store version and leave a review!

---

### **Q: Can I have different features in TestFlight vs App Store?**
**A**: Yes! Common practice. TestFlight has experimental features, App Store has stable features.

---

### **Q: Which is harder to get approved?**
**A**: App Store is much stricter. TestFlight beta review is lenient (mostly checking it won't crash).
